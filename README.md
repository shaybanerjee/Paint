<h1> Project Description: </h1> 
This is a sketching program created to better understand MVC in JAVA. 

<ul>
    <li> The drawing application supports different stroke widths, multiple colors, window resizing. A scrubber and a play forward and back button is available to use. </li>
    <li> The menu bar at the top has a file button that allows users to SAVE, LOAD, EXIT, and create NEW drawings (supports .txt format). </li>
    <li> The palette on the left supports many colors, and also provides the option to select a custom color. The selected color can be seen above the palette. </li> 
    <li> The main area of the application is a canvas that supports drawing at various stroke thicknesses and colours. </li> 
    <li> The bottom of the screen has a scrubber to slide through an animation of the drawing manually. There is also a play forward and play backward button used to automatically play animation of the drawing. (enhancement)</li> 
    <li> When playing back and drawing some of the later strokes will vanish and the application will only consider your new strokes. </li> 
    <li> Dynamic layout, all components get resized appropriately. </li>
</ul>

The application can be run using ./gradlew run.
